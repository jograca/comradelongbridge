Glory to Workers!

This is a description of how comradelongbridge.com automation works.

Work on this README is still in progress as of Feb 27th 2017, Comrade!

BASICS:

The goal of this automation project is to take a "share" submission via email from http://www.nytimes.com/puzzles for the daily NYT MINI crossword, pump it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, and display it on a drupal site as an iframe. Currently the Share function from NYT is only available on iOS.
